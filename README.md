# Accessible Colour Palette Designer

As the title suggests, this is a tool intended to help designers and web developers create colour palettes that follow the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#contrast-minimum) for colour contrast.

Users should be able to choose colours to include in their palette by either inputting a hex code or using a colour picker. They can also include black or white by checking the relevant checkboxes.

Colour contrast between each possible combination is then automatically calculated and the combinations are displayed for the following categories: AAA, AA, and Low Contrast.

This allows users to experiment with colour choices until they find a palette that provides suitably accessible colours.

This was heavily inspired by [a11y Rocks](http://a11yrocks.com/colorPalette); however, I wanted a tool that would allow me to select colours with a picker and see the contrast options update in real time. 

Below are some other resources I've found helpful for generating colour palettes:

* [Adobe Color](https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel)
* [Canva Color Wheel](https://www.canva.com/colors/color-wheel/)
* [Coolors](https://coolors.co/463f3a-8a817c-bcb8b1-f4f3ee-e0afa0)
* [Encycolorpedia](https://encycolorpedia.com/eb667d)


I am still learning about accessible web design, so any feedback on how this can be improved is welcome!


Note: I am aware of an issue where if the user excludes colours as background or text, this disrupts the default layout. I will fix this when I have some free time.
